# Python Smart Home Control Module

This application is designed to connect to existing smart home installations and perform control tasks according to a given strategy.
It requires existing infrastructure that collects datapoints from the relevant devices for use in its control strategy.

Where datapoints come from and where control inputs are sent to is not particularly important, and it can easily be connected to a simulation running on a supported format.
